Hi, my name is
Daniel Liew 刘家濠
I build, design, and engineer digital experiences.

### About Me

Hello! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Daniel and I'm a Junior at Rollins College in the picturesque city of Winter Park, FL.

I love building websites and mobile applications that positively impact the world around me and improve the daily lives of others. I've always taken a keen interest towards problem solving and creative thinking. From building elegant and powerful frontend designs to complex and functional backend APIs, I want to use programming as a creative medium for bringing purposeful ideas to fruition.

I've had the priveledge of interning at `one of Malaysia's leading conglomerates`, `a multinational cement manufacturer`, and `an IT strategy and deployment consultantcy firm`. Nowadays, I'm building user-friendly, inclusive, and accessible digital experiences at `one of Malaysia's largest swim schools`.
